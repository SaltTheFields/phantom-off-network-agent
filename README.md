## What is this?

Phantom is a ReAct-style AI research agent that:

- **Runs 100% locally** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — your gaming PC, your rules
- **Searches the web** via DuckDuckGo — no API key, no tracking, no account
- **Builds a knowledge vault** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-compatible markdown with live WikiLinks and auto-maintained backlinks
- **Remembers everything** across sessions via SQLite full-text search
- **Works the research queue** automatically — run it on a schedule, come back to a filled vault
- **Assigns models to topics** — route tech questions to codellama, creative research to llama3, etc.

This is a research tool for people who want to think deeply about topics over time, offline from their personal identity.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaltTheFields/phantom-off-network-agent
cd phantom-off-network-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"  # Optional: for web dashboard
```

### Configure

Edit `config.json` — at minimum set your Ollama address:

```json
{
  "ollama": {
    "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
    "model": "llama3.2"
  }
}
```

If Ollama is on another machine (e.g. a gaming PC), set `base_url` to its IP and start Ollama with:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve
```

### Run

```bash
# Interactive mode
py agent.py
```
```

## Web Dashboard

Phantom includes a local, privacy-first web dashboard (default: `http://localhost:7777`) featuring:

- **Live Research Feed**: Real-time tool calls and agent reasoning.
- **Auto-Tailing Log**: Continuous stream of the daily JSONL log.
- **Knowledge Depth**: Visual distribution of your vault's research maturity.
- **Dynamic Accent**: The UI color shifts based on the time of day.
- **Responsive Logo**: The ASCII title animates and glows when active.
- **In-Browser Editor**: Edit note content and metadata directly from the vault view.
- **Full Configuration**: Update `config.json` and `agents.json` without leaving the browser.

---

## How it works

Phantom uses the **ReAct pattern** (Reason + Act). For every message it:

1. Searches long-term memory for relevant context
2. Calls the LLM with your message + context + static context file
3. If the LLM outputs a tool call → executes it → feeds result back
4. Repeats until the LLM gives a final answer (up to 8 iterations)

```
You: "What is the current state of fusion energy?"

  [iter 1] → recall("fusion energy")          → no prior memories
  [iter 2] → web_search("fusion energy 2025")  → 5 results
  [iter 3] → fetch_page("https://...")         → full article text
  [iter 4] → remember("ITER achieved Q>1...")  → saved to SQLite
  [iter 5] → update_note("Fusion Energy", ...) → vault/fusion-energy.md updated
  [final]  → synthesized answer with citations
```

## The Vault

Research notes live in `vault/` as Obsidian-compatible markdown:

```
vault/
├── _index.md              ← auto-generated topic index
├── daily/
│   └── 2026-03-29.md     ← research digest from each scheduled run
├── fusion-energy.md
├── sam-altman.md
└── rust-tokio.md
```

Each note has:
- **YAML frontmatter** — status, priority, type, tags, refresh interval, plus cumulative research stats (`research_runs`, `total_sources_fetched`, `last_run_elapsed_s`, etc.)
- **WikiLinks** — `[[Related Topic]]` forward links authored by the agent
- **Auto backlinks** — maintained automatically via `<!-- backlinks-start/end -->` sentinels
- **Conflict warnings** — `> [!warning]` callouts when new research contradicts existing facts

Open the `vault/` folder directly in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for the full graph view.

## Bulk Topic Import

Load many topics at once from a plain text or JSON file.

**Text format** (`topics.txt`):
```
Fusion Energy           | tech     | high   | iter, plasma, nuclear | 14
Ada Lovelace            | person   | high   | computing, history    | 30
Byzantine Fault Tolerance | concept | medium | distributed, consensus | 21
```
Fields: `name | type | priority | tags | refresh_days` — all except name are optional.

**JSON format** (`topics.json`):
```json
[
  {"name": "Fusion Energy", "type": "tech", "priority": "high", "tags": ["iter", "plasma"], "refresh_interval_days": 14},
  {"name": "Ada Lovelace", "type": "person", "priority": "high"}
]
```

```
/topic import my-topics.txt

Import preview (3 topics):
  [NEW]   Fusion Energy                 tech      high    14d
  [NEW]   Ada Lovelace                  person    high    30d
  [SKIP]  Byzantine Fault Tolerance     already exists

Create 2 new topics? [y/N]: y
  Created: Fusion Energy
  Created: Ada Lovelace
  Skipped: Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Done. Created: 2 | Skipped: 1 | Errors: 0
```

Export your current topics for editing or sharing:
```
/topic export queued
→ Exported 14 queued topics to: topic-export-queued-2026-03-29.json
```

## Run Logs

Every run writes structured JSONL logs to `logs/phantom-YYYY-MM-DD.log`:

```json
{"ts": "2026-03-29T14:32:07", "level": "INFO", "event": "run_start", "mode": "scheduled", "model": "llama3.2", "queue_size": 14}
{"ts": "2026-03-29T14:32:09", "level": "INFO", "event": "tool_call", "tool": "web_search", "query": "fusion energy breakthroughs 2025", "topic": "fusion-energy"}
{"ts": "2026-03-29T14:32:22", "level": "INFO", "event": "topic_done", "topic": "Fusion Energy", "elapsed_s": 14.2, "sources": 3, "iterations": 5}
{"ts": "2026-03-29T14:45:10", "level": "INFO", "event": "run_done", "topics_completed": 10, "topics_failed": 0, "total_elapsed_s": 252}
```

Logs are auto-rotated after `max_log_age_days` (default: 30 days). `logs/` is gitignored.

---

## Multi-Model Routing

Assign different Ollama models to different research areas:

```
/agents                                   ← show roster with VRAM status
/agents assign mistral tech               ← mistral handles all 'tech' topics
/agents assign llama3.2 research          ← llama3.2 for general research
/agents assign codellama topic:rust-async ← codellama for one specific topic
/agents clear mistral                     ← remove assignments
```

The **CuratorAgent** broker auto-selects the best available model for free-form chat based on capabilities and what's already loaded in VRAM — no model swap penalty if the right model is already hot.

---

## Semantic Memory

Phantom uses [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~80MB) to give memory search a semantic layer. When you `recall` a fact, results are ranked by a hybrid of full-text keyword match (FTS5 BM25) and cosine similarity between embeddings — so related concepts surface even when exact words don't match.

**First run only**: the model is downloaded from Hugging Face (~80MB, one-time). After that it's cached locally and loads silently. The download is automatic but stays on your machine — nothing is sent to any cloud service.

To check if it's active:

```bash
py -c "import embeddings; print('semantic search:', embeddings.is_available())"
```

If `sentence-transformers` is not installed, Phantom falls back gracefully to keyword-only FTS5 search — no errors, just less fuzz tolerance on recall.

---

## Consensus Mode

Consensus mode runs a topic through **two independent Ollama models** and then uses a third (broker) model to reconcile the outputs. The result tends to be more thorough and self-correcting than a single-model run.

**It is off by default** (`consensus_mode: false` in `config.json`). To enable it you need at least two Ollama models pulled locally:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull mistral
```

Then in `config.json`:

```json
"agent": {
  "consensus_mode": true,
  "consensus_min_depth": 2
}
```

- `consensus_min_depth` gates the expensive dual-model run to topics that have already been researched at least N times. Shallow or first-pass topics use your primary model only.
- `broker_model` sets the reconciler. Defaults to the same value as `ollama.model` if not specified.

If you only have one model, leave `consensus_mode: false` — the feature has no benefit and adds significant time per topic.

---

## Static Context

Edit `context.md` to give the agent persistent background knowledge injected into every prompt:

```markdown
## Research Goals
Track developments in AI, cybersecurity, and privacy tooling.

## Global Rules
- Always cite sources with direct URLs.
- Flag information older than 1 year as potentially outdated.

## Domain Knowledge
I am a software developer focused on privacy-first local tooling.

## Avoid
- Social media profile pages
- Press releases treated as objective fact
```

```
/context           ← print current context
/context reload    ← pick up edits without restarting
```

## Privacy

- **No cloud LLM** — all inference runs on your Ollama instance
- **No accounts** — DuckDuckGo search requires zero authentication
- **No telemetry** — this tool phones home to nothing
- **Local data only** — `data/memory.db`, `vault/`, and `logs/` stay on your machine
- **`.gitignore` guards** — `data/`, `logs/`, and `topic-export*.json` are excluded from version control

---

## Stack
